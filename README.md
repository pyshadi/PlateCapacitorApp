# Capacitor Simulation

This is a web application that allows you to simulate the behavior of a capacitor in different scenarios. You can visualize the charging and discharging processes of a capacitor and observe how the voltage, current, and charge change over time.

## Features

- Simulate DC charging of a capacitor.
- Simulate DC discharging of a capacitor.
- Choose different plot types: Current/Time, Voltage/Time, and Charge/Time.
- Update the capacitance value based on the area, separation, and permittivity inputs.
- Interactive plot with hover tooltips to display values.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Bokeh

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Run the application:
```
       python main.py
```

2. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

# Usage
1. Enter the values for the area, separation, permittivity, resistance, and initial voltage of the capacitor in the input fields.
2. Select the simulation type (DC Charging or DC Discharging).
3. Select the plot type (Current/Time, Voltage/Time, or Charge/Time).
4. Click the "Submit" button to generate the simulation plot.
5. The capacitance value will be automatically updated based on the area, separation, and permittivity inputs.
